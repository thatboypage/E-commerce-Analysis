## **Insights & Findings**
Through data analysis using **Pandas**, we uncovered several key insights that can help improve business strategy and customer engagement:

## 1. Customer Behavior & Purchasing Patterns
- A significant number of purchases occur during the PM hours, indicating that customers prefer shopping in the evening.
- Customers with job titles containing "Engineer" show a higher tendency to make frequent purchases.

## 2. Sales & Pricing Insights
- The highest and lowest purchase prices reveal a large variance in spending habits, highlighting the need for tiered pricing strategies.
- The average purchase price provides a benchmark for setting discounts and promotional offers.

## 3. Payment & Transaction Trends
- Customers using MasterCard as their payment method tend to make higher-value transactions.
- A significant number of customers had credit cards expiring in 2020, indicating a potential lapse in repeat purchases due to outdated payment methods.

## 4. Email Provider & Contact Insights
- The top 5 most popular email providers suggest the best platforms for targeted email marketing campaigns.
- Extracting customer emails based on IP addresses and credit card numbers can help in fraud detection and personalized communication.

 ## **Business Impact & Recommendations**
- Optimize Sales Timing: Since most purchases occur in the PM, running promotions and ads during this period can maximize revenue.
- Personalized Marketing: Target high-spending job roles (e.g., Engineers) with exclusive offers.
- Payment Optimization: Encourage customers to update expired cards to prevent transaction failures.
- Email Marketing Strategy: Focus on the most-used email providers to enhance outreach efforts.
